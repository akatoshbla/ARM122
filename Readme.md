Project 2 - This program opens and reads a string from a file. It then performs an add of the individual bytes in memory. By performing a one's complement and by truncating the result we arrive at a base 10 checksum.

Project 3 - This program opens and reads a group of ints and stores them into memory. Then the ints are sorted and print into a text file.

Project 4 - This program uses the embest board plug in for armsim. The program uses the LCD, 8-segment display, the blue buttons, and the black buttons to act like a hex to decimal adder.(Single digit at a time) The black buttons will reset the lcd, clear the 8-segment display, and the running sum to 0. 

Project 5 - This program uses the embest board plug in for armsim. The program acts like a safe - left black button locks and right black button will program. The safe keeps a memory of all the codes and checks them everytime someone tries to unlock. If a code is used when the right black is pressed it will delete it. When entering a new code it is confirmed. Coder's note to self: (Used pc, lr, stack, and some other tricks with conditionals.)
